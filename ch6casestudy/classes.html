                <h3>Gentle Hatha Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                    A 60 minute class of poses and slow movement that focuses on asana 
                    (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and guided 
                    meditation to foster your mind and body connection. This class is 
                    intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga.
                </p>

                <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                    A 60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement â€” you will 
                    inhale and exhale as you flow energetically through yoga poses. While 
                    intended for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to join in this class.

                <h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
                <p>
                    A 90 minute class that features very slow movement and long poses. Restorative 
                    yoga is useful in relieving stress and fostering a sense of well-being. This 
                    calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of any level of experience.
